Python Scripts, which create a structure that should be presented in VR by Virtual Atoms, should be stored in this folder. They have to be able to send data to Unity (f.g. by using the Sender script) and to handle input.

It is not yet implemented that scripts, stored in Folders which are located in this Folder, can be reached while using the Virtual Atoms. This should be implemented in the future, if the Amount of possible files gets too high.

Files should be named as following:
	- the name should just contain one word
	- the name should not contain .txt
	- there should be no files in this folder containing .py in their name
	- example: IronStructureLarge(.py) <- the .py should be autogenerated when saving the file as a python file
